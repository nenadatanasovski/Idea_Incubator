# E2E Test Progress Notes
# ========================
# This file tracks what each agent session accomplished.

[2025-12-31 Session 3] Working on TEST-BI-006
- Identified bug: Backend returns 'ideaCandidate' but frontend expects 'candidateUpdate'
- Fixed server/routes/ideation.ts to return 'candidateUpdate' instead of 'ideaCandidate'
- Also added confidence, viability, and risks fields to API response
- Fixed both /api/ideation/message and /api/ideation/button endpoints
- Committed fix: "Fix TEST-BI-006: Align candidateUpdate field name between backend and frontend"
- Browser session became unresponsive (detached Frame error), could not verify fix via UI
- Progress: 22/64 passing (code fix committed but NOT yet verified via browser)
- Next: Next agent should verify the fix works by navigating to /ideate, starting a session,
  and checking that the Idea Candidate panel updates when conversation progresses


[2025-12-31 19:49] Session 8 Complete
- Fixed: TEST-BI-006 (Button Response Updates Candidate)
- Root cause: mergeState() in orchestrator.ts was overwriting arrays with objects
  when LLM returned partial updates (e.g., {gaps: {}} overwrote gaps: [])
- Code changed: agents/ideation/orchestrator.ts - added check to skip updates 
  where existing value is array but update is not
- Verified: 6+ messages processed without 'gaps.some is not a function' error
- Verified: Idea Forming progress bar displays and updates
- Progress: 23/64 passing (was 22/64)
- Next: TEST-FH-001 (Form Display) or other pending tests


[2025-12-31 20:03] Session 9 Complete
- Fixed: Orchestrator not returning risks array (was missing from response)
- Code changed: agents/ideation/orchestrator.ts - added risks to OrchestratorResponse
- Passed: TEST-CM-001 (Candidate Panel), TEST-CM-002 (Title Gen), TEST-CM-003 (Summary Gen)
- Blocked: TEST-FH-001 through TEST-FH-004 (Forms are AI-generated, not deterministic)
- Verified: Candidate panel shows title, summary, confidence, viability correctly
- Progress: 26/64 passing (was 23/64)
- Next: TEST-CM-004 (Confidence Updates), TEST-CM-005 (Viability + Risks display)
