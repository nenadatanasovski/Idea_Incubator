# E2E Test Progress Notes
# ========================
# This file tracks what each agent session accomplished.

[2025-12-31 Session 3] Working on TEST-BI-006
- Identified bug: Backend returns 'ideaCandidate' but frontend expects 'candidateUpdate'
- Fixed server/routes/ideation.ts to return 'candidateUpdate' instead of 'ideaCandidate'
- Also added confidence, viability, and risks fields to API response
- Fixed both /api/ideation/message and /api/ideation/button endpoints
- Committed fix: "Fix TEST-BI-006: Align candidateUpdate field name between backend and frontend"
- Browser session became unresponsive (detached Frame error), could not verify fix via UI
- Progress: 22/64 passing (code fix committed but NOT yet verified via browser)
- Next: Next agent should verify the fix works by navigating to /ideate, starting a session,
  and checking that the Idea Candidate panel updates when conversation progresses
