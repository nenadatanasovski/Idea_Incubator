# Solar-Powered Phone Charger

## Overview

A compact, portable solar panel that can charge smartphones efficiently while hiking, camping, or traveling.

## Problem Statement

Outdoor enthusiasts often run out of phone battery in remote areas where access to electricity is limited. This can be a safety concern and limits the use of useful apps like GPS, camera, and emergency communication.

## Target Users

- Hikers and backpackers
- Campers
- Travelers in developing countries
- Emergency preparedness enthusiasts

## Proposed Solution

A lightweight, foldable solar panel with integrated battery bank that can:
- Charge a smartphone in 3-4 hours of direct sunlight
- Store enough power for 2 full phone charges
- Weigh less than 500g
- Fit in a backpack side pocket

## Initial Questions

1. What is the optimal panel size for portability vs. charging speed?
2. What battery chemistry provides the best weight-to-capacity ratio?
3. How weather-resistant does it need to be?
