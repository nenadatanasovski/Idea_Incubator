# User Journey & Core Flows

## Phase 1: Acquisition & Hook

### Ad/Social Media Hook

- **Boys hook**: "Do you know how to play it cool with her?"
- **Influencer content**: Shows actual app interactions — funny, engaging, surprise element
- **Key principle**: Show don't tell. The gameplay IS the marketing.

### Install → Registration

- Minimal friction registration (social login preferred)
- Basic info only: age verification, username
- Save detailed preferences for next step (feels like gameplay, not forms)

---

## Phase 2: Onboarding as Gameplay

### Preference Discovery (Slides)

- Sexual orientation selection
- Physical preference builder (not a form — interactive)
  - Swipe/tap through options
  - "Who catches your eye?" framing
- This data feeds persona generation

### The Catapult Animation

**This is the magic moment** — transition from "app" to "experience"

User gets launched into a random scene:

- 🚌 Bus
- 🚂 Train
- ☕ Coffee shop
- 📚 Library
- 🎉 Party
- 🏃 Gym

## Phase 3: Scene & Opportunity System

### Scene Variables (Randomly Generated)

| Variable          | Options                                                 | Impact                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Location          | Bus, train, cafe, party, etc.                           | Sets context/vibe      |
| Time pressure     | Relaxed / She's about to leave / Brief window           | Forces decision speed  |
| Opportunity type  | Eye contact made / Seated nearby / Bump into each other | Different openers work |
| Her initial state | Open/friendly / Distracted / In a hurry                 | Affects difficulty     |

### User Actions in Scene

1. **Wait and observe** — May miss the chance, but can read the room
2. **Approach immediately** — Bold, might score or backfire
3. **Create an opportunity** — (e.g., "accidentally" drop something nearby)
4. **React to random event** — Something happens that creates natural opener

### Timing Mechanics

- Some scenes have countdown (she's getting off next stop)
- Some are relaxed (library, she's studying)
- Miss the window = conversation doesn't happen, but you learn something

## Phase 4: Conversation System

### Girl Persona (AI Agent)

Randomly generated composite:

- **Personality type**: Shy / Confident / Playful / Intellectual / Mysterious / Warm
- **Current mood**: Happy / Stressed / Bored / Curious / Guarded
- **Interests**: 3-5 randomly assigned (music, sports, books, travel, etc.)
- **Communication style**: Direct / Subtle / Sarcastic / Earnest
- **Deal breakers**: 1-2 things that will end the conversation badly
- **Hidden likes**: Things that will make her light up if discovered

### Conversation Mechanics

**User input options:**

- 4 predefined text responses per turn (varied tones):
  - 😎 Cool/confident
  - 💚 Warm/heartfelt
  - 🤪 Funny/risky (might land or cringe)
  - 🤔 Curious/question

**Expression selection (non-verbal):**

- 6-8 expressions to pair with text
- Some girls care about non-verbal cues, some don't
- Mismatch between words and expression can help or hurt

**AI Response includes:**

- Her text reply
- Her expression/body language
- Subtle cues about how it's going (if you're paying attention)

## Phase 5: Outcome & Feedback

### Conversation Endings

| Outcome               | Trigger                            | Feedback                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 🔥 Great connection   | Hit her interests, good vibe       | "She gives you her number"     |
| 😊 Decent chat        | Okay conversation, nothing special | "She smiles and says bye"      |
| 😐 Awkward exit       | Misread cues, wrong approach       | "She makes an excuse to leave" |
| 💀 Crashed and burned | Hit a deal breaker, cringe moment  | "She's suddenly very busy"     |
| ⏰ Missed opportunity | Waited too long                    | "Her stop comes. She's gone."  |

### Post-Conversation

- Thumbs up/down on the experience (validation metric)
- Brief "what worked / what didn't" hint (learning value)
- Points added to running score
- "Ready for another?" → New scene catapult

## Core Loops

### Session Loop (2-5 minutes)

```
Scene Drop → Observe/Act → Conversation (if started) → Outcome → Feedback → Next Scene
```

### Progression Loop (across sessions)

```
Play → Earn points → (Future: Unlock new scenes/personas/expressions)
```

### Retention Loop (daily)

```
Push notification hook → Quick session → Satisfying outcome → Return tomorrow
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Never feel like a "lesson"** — It's a game that happens to teach
2. **Unpredictability is the feature** — Same approach won't always work
3. **Failure is entertaining** — Crashing and burning should be funny, not punishing
4. **Short sessions, high density** — Lots happens in 3 minutes
5. **The mystery** — Is she AI? Is she real? (Future feature, but plant the seed early)

## Open Questions

- [ ] How many predefined text options per turn? (4 feels right)
- [ ] How long before expressions feel repetitive?
- [ ] What's the "daily limit" for free tier?
- [ ] How do we make "missed opportunities" feel like learning, not punishment?
- [ ] Voice messages in future? Or text-only forever?
