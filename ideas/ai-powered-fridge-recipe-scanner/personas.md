| **Tech Savvy** | High - smartphone power user |
| **Market Size** | 45M (US) |

#### Psychographic Profile
Sarah is a 34-year-old Marketing Manager who values efficiency above all else. She's health-conscious but struggles to translate that intention into action. She experiences decision fatigue by evening and defaults to convenience options (takeout, meal kits) even though she has a stocked fridge. She feels guilty about food waste but lacks the mental energy to solve the "what's for dinner" problem daily.

#### Daily Life Context
| Time | Without App | With App |
|------|-------------|----------|

1. **Decision fatigue** - Too tired to think about cooking after work
2. **Time pressure** - Needs meals ready in under 30 minutes
3. **Food waste guilt** - Regularly throws out expired ingredients
