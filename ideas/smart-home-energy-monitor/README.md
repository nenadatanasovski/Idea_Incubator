# Smart Home Energy Monitor

## Problem
Homeowners waste 20-30% of their electricity due to inefficient appliances and poor usage habits. The average US household spends $1,500/year on electricity with no visibility into what's consuming energy.

## Solution
A smart plug-in device that clips onto the main electrical panel and uses machine learning to:
- Identify individual appliances by their electrical signatures
- Track real-time consumption per device
- Predict monthly bills
- Send alerts for unusual usage patterns
- Recommend optimal usage times based on utility rates

## Technology
Built with ESP32 microcontroller, current transformer sensors, and TensorFlow Lite for on-device ML. Mobile app in React Native.

## Market
The smart home energy market is projected to reach $15B by 2027. Competitors include Sense, Emporia, and Neurio. Our differentiation is the AI-powered recommendations and lower price point ($99 vs $300+).

## Target Users
Environmentally conscious homeowners aged 30-55 who want to reduce energy bills and carbon footprint.
