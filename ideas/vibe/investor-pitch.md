# Vibe — Investor Pitch

**Prepared:** January 4, 2025
**Stage:** Pre-seed / Angel
**Location:** Sydney, Australia

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

**Vibe turns dreamers into founders.**

Most people with business ideas never build them — not because the ideas are bad, but because the path from idea to product is impossibly complex.

Vibe is an AI platform that guides non-technical users from "I have an idea" to "I have a live app" — completely. We don't just help you build. We help you figure out *what* to build. Then we build it. Then we help you grow it.

The user never sees code. Ever. We handle everything.

And we succeed when they succeed — our revenue grows as their apps grow.

## The Problem

### The Idea Graveyard

**42% of startups fail because they build something nobody wants.** (CB Insights)

But the real tragedy happens earlier: **millions of capable people never build anything at all.**

Why?

| Barrier | What Happens |
|---------|--------------|
| **No clarity** | "I have an idea" but can't articulate what it actually is |
| **No validation** | Don't know if anyone wants it before investing months |
| **No technical skills** | Can't code, can't afford developers |
| **No guidance** | Dozens of tools exist, but no one ties them together |
| **No time** | Full-time jobs, families, competing priorities |

The result: Ideas die in notebooks. Dreams become regrets.

### The Broken Toolchain

Current solutions fail because they're fragmented:

| Category | Tools | The Gap |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **Validation** | Validator AI, DimeADozen | Stop at a report — don't build |
| **Building** | Lovable, Bolt, Replit | Assume you know what to build — you don't |
| **No-code** | Bubble, Webflow | Still require learning curves |
| **Networking** | LinkedIn, communities | Passive — you have to hunt for connections |

**Nobody connects these.** Users cobble together 5 tools and hope they work together.

---

## The Solution: Vibe

**One platform. Idea to income.**

### The Three Pillars

| Pillar | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Ideation** | AI guides you from vague idea to validated concept | No more "garbage in, garbage out" |
| **Building** | AI builds your app with full context from ideation | You don't need to code or spec perfectly |
| **Network** | AI proactively connects you with collaborators, customers, opportunities | Growth happens while you sleep |

### The Experience

1. **"What makes you tick?"** — Vibe starts with passion, not product
2. **Conversational exploration** — AI asks questions, you answer. Idea emerges.
3. **Collaborate** — Invite friends, experts, potential customers to refine
4. **Specification through dialogue** — Requirements extracted naturally
5. **AI builds** — Code generated with full business context
6. **Launch & grow** — Deployed instantly; AI surfaces growth opportunities

### The Key Innovation

**The user never sees code. Never manages servers. Never worries about updates.**

Vibe handles the entire technical lifecycle — forever.

This is the trade-off: You're locked in, but you're also *liberated*. Technical burden disappears permanently.

## Why Now?

### The Moment Has Arrived

| Signal | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **"Vibe coding" is mainstream** | Collins Dictionary Word of the Year 2025 |
| **AI capability crossed threshold** | Y Combinator: 25% of Spring 2025 batch was 95%+ AI-generated code |
| **Market is exploding** | No-code market: $28B (2024) → $265B (2032), 32% CAGR |
| **User expectations have shifted** | People expect AI to do more, not just assist |

### Why This Hasn't Been Built

| Reason | Our Answer |
|--------|------------|
| Ideation and building are treated as separate | We unified them |
| Tools are built for developers/designers | We built for non-technical dreamers |
| Platforms are transactional | We built an ongoing AI partnership |
| Nobody invested in self-improving systems | We built agents that improve other agents |

---

## Market Opportunity

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Global no-code market (2024)** | $28.75 billion | Mordor Intelligence |
| **Projected market (2032)** | $264.40 billion | Mordor Intelligence |
| **CAGR** | 32.2% | |
| **Apps built with low-code by 2026** | 75% of all new apps | Gartner |
| **AI startup funding (2025)** | $202.3B (50% of global VC) | Crunchbase |

### Our Niche

The intersection of:
- People with ideas (everyone)
- Without technical skills (most people)
- Willing to pay for results ($$$)

This is not a small niche. This is the future of software creation.

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

| Stream | Mechanism | When It Kicks In |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| **Hosting + DB** | Base cost + margin | App deployed |
| **Feature Garden** | Monthly fee per feature enabled | User enables features |
| **Custom Features** | Credits for AI agent work | User requests changes |
| **Vibe Payments** | Optional — % of transactions | User uses our payment system |
| **Paid Testing** | Fee on tester compensation | User pays for beta testers |

### Credit System

- Free credits on signup (explore the platform)
- Credits consumed by AI interactions
- Must purchase credits to continue complex builds
- Complexity = more credits = more revenue

### Aligned Incentives

**We make more money when users succeed.**

- Successful apps use more hosting
- Growing apps enable more features
- Happy users request more custom work
- Thriving apps process more transactions

This is not a zero-sum game. We win together.

### Unit Economics (Projected)

| Metric | Assumption |
|--------|------------|
| **CAC** | $30-50 (organic-first strategy) |
| **LTV** | $200-500 (18-month horizon) |
| **Gross margin** | 70-80% (AI API costs are variable) |
| **Payback period** | 3-6 months |

*Note: These are projections to be validated during MVP.*

## Competitive Advantage

### The Moat

| Advantage | Why Competitors Can't Copy |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Ideation → Build context handoff** | Requires rethinking product architecture from scratch |
| **Proactive continuous AI** | Competitors are session-based tools, not ongoing partners |
| **Self-optimizing platform** | Agents that improve other agents require infrastructure investment |
| **"Never see code" philosophy** | Lock-in customers would revolt; we designed for it |
| **Network effects from day one** | Collaboration starts in ideation; not bolted on later |

### Self-Improvement Agent (SIA)

Our secret weapon: **Agents that improve other agents.**

| How It Works | Why It Matters |
|--------------|----------------|
| SIA triggers when an agent is stuck | Problems get solved without human intervention |
| Analyzes transcripts of failed attempts | Learns from mistakes automatically |
| Modifies agent instructions to improve | Platform evolves continuously |
| Tracks history to prevent regression | Only ships improvements |

**Result:** The platform gets better every day — even when we're not working on it.

### Testing Agents with Browser Control

Autonomous testing agents simulate real users continuously:
- Run through user journeys
- Capture errors and friction
- Surface improvement opportunities
- Auto-fix simple issues

**Result:** Quality improves without manual QA.

### Positioning

```
                    BUILDS APPS
                        ↑
    Lovable  •    Replit •
              •  Bolt    • Cursor
                        |
DOESN'T GUIDE ←---------+--------→ GUIDES IDEATION
IDEATION                |
              • Bubble  |        • Validator AI
                        |        • DimeADozen

                DOESN'T BUILD

                    ★ VIBE (Unique Position)
                    Guides ideation AND builds
```

**We occupy whitespace.** No one else unifies ideation, building, and networking in a single continuous experience.

## Appendix: Skeptic Challenges We've Addressed

*These are questions you might ask. We've already thought about them.*

| Challenge | Our Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| "Self-improving agents might make things worse" | Deterministic pass/fail criteria; internal memory tracks what worked |
| "Context is lost in agent handoffs" | Git history + transcripts preserve context |
| "Lock-in is predatory" | Liberation trade-off; Platform Continuity clause if we shut down |
| "Revenue share is unenforceable" | Only applies to optional Vibe Payments |
| "Network requires critical mass" | Network is multiplier, not MVP requirement; standalone value first |
| "AI can't handle complex legal/regulatory" | AI prepares; human professional advises; T&Cs disclaim |
| "15-20 hrs/week isn't enough" | Ralph loops accelerate; triggers defined for full-time |
