# Vibe — Elevator Pitches

**Quick reference for different contexts and time constraints.**

## 10-Second Pitch

**"Vibe is the AI platform that turns dreamers into founders — from 'I have an idea' to 'I have a live app,' without ever touching code."**

---

## 30-Second Pitch

Most people with business ideas never build them — not because the ideas are bad, but because the path is impossibly complex.

Vibe is an AI platform that guides non-technical users from vague idea to live app — completely. We help you figure out what to build, then we build it, then we help you grow it.

The user never sees code. We handle everything. And we succeed when they succeed.

---

## 60-Second Pitch

42% of startups fail because they build something nobody wants. But the real tragedy? Millions of capable people never build anything at all — ideas die in notebooks because the path from idea to product is broken.

Vibe fixes this.

We're an AI platform with three connected pillars: **Ideation** — we guide you from vague idea to validated concept through conversation. **Building** — our AI builds your app with full context from ideation, no garbage prompts. **Network** — our AI proactively connects you with collaborators, customers, and growth opportunities.

The user never sees code. Never manages servers. Never worries about updates. We handle the entire technical lifecycle — forever.

Our business model aligns our success with theirs: we make money when their apps make money.

The no-code market is $28 billion today, heading to $265 billion by 2032. "Vibe coding" was Collins Dictionary's Word of the Year. The moment is now.

We're seeking investment to complete our MVP and acquire our first 100 users beyond friends and family.

## 2-Minute Pitch

**The Problem:**

Every year, millions of people have business ideas that could change their lives. But 99% never build anything. Why? Because the path from idea to product is broken.

Validation tools give you a report and disappear. AI builders assume you already know exactly what to want — you don't. No-code platforms still require learning curves. And everything is disconnected.

The result: ideas die in notebooks. Dreams become regrets.

**The Solution:**

Vibe is the first AI platform that connects the entire journey.

**Pillar one: Ideation.** We don't start with "what do you want to build?" We start with "what makes you tick?" Our AI guides you through a conversation that transforms vague ideas into validated, fully-specified concepts. By the time you're ready to build, you actually know what you're building — and why.

**Pillar two: Building.** Because our AI has full context from ideation, there's no "garbage in, garbage out." The build agent generates real, working apps. When it gets stuck, it asks for help. When it finishes, your app is live.

**Pillar three: Network.** Most platforms leave you alone after you build. Vibe doesn't. Our AI proactively surfaces collaboration opportunities, potential customers, and growth strategies. It reaches out through notifications, email, even phone calls when something important happens.

The user never sees code. Never manages servers. Never worries about updates. We handle it all — forever.

**The Business Model:**

We make money when users succeed. Hosting fees, feature subscriptions, and optional revenue share when they use our payment system. The more their apps grow, the more we grow.

**The Market:**

The no-code market is $28 billion and growing at 32% per year. "Vibe coding" was just named Word of the Year. Gartner says 75% of new apps will be low-code by 2026. This is the moment.

**Why Us:**

I've been building apps for 10 years. I built Vibe's ideation agent using our own Ralph loop methodology — AI-assisted development with human oversight. It works. I've proven it.

But more importantly: no one else is connecting ideation, building, and networking. We're in whitespace.

**The Ask:**

We're raising to complete our MVP and acquire our first 100 users outside my network. With traction, we'll raise a proper seed round to scale.

The dream we're enabling: everyone who wants to build something for themselves finally can.

## Objection Handlers

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Isn't this just another AI builder?" | "AI builders assume you know what to build. 42% of startups fail because they build the wrong thing. We solve that by starting with ideation, not just building." |
| "What if I want my code?" | "You own your app, not the code — but you also never have to worry about code. Most founders don't want to manage servers and deployments. We handle it forever." |
| "Why would I trust an AI with my idea?" | "You control what's shared. Our platform includes confidentiality protections, and frankly — having an idea is easy. Executing it is hard. We help with execution." |
| "The no-code space is crowded" | "For builders, yes. For dreamers — people who don't even know where to start — it's empty. We serve the huge market that current tools ignore." |
