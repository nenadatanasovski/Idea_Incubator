## Post-90 Day: Scale Phase

After Day 90, focus shifts based on what's learned:

### If traction is strong (exceeding metrics):

- Product Hunt launch
- Accelerate marketing spend test ($500-1K)
- Begin co-founder search actively
- Consider raising pre-seed

### If traction is moderate (meeting metrics):

- Continue iteration based on feedback
- Focus on retention over acquisition
- Build more features users request
- Extend runway thinking

### If traction is weak (missing metrics):

- Interview users who churned — find the gap
- Consider pivot on positioning (different audience?)
- Assess whether more time or different approach needed
- Honest evaluation of venture viability
