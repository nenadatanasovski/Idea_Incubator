## Anti-Personas (Who We Don't Target)

### Technical Founders

- **Why not:** They can build themselves; Cursor/Replit serve them better
- **Signal:** Have GitHub account, can code

### Enterprise IT Buyers

- **Why not:** Need compliance, procurement cycles, support SLAs
- **Signal:** Want SOC2, dedicated account manager

### Get-Rich-Quick Seekers

- **Why not:** Unrealistic expectations, high churn, bad reviews
- **Signal:** Asks about "passive income" in first message

### Idea Hoarders

- **Why not:** Will never convert to paid; endless exploration
- **Signal:** Generates 10+ ideas but never advances any

### Budget-Zero Users

- **Why not:** Can't monetize; looking for completely free solutions
- **Signal:** Objects to any pricing tier

## Messaging Framework

### Primary Message (Corporate Side-Hustler)

**Headline:** "Finally turn your idea into a real app"

**Subhead:** "No coding. No hiring. Just you and AI, building together."

**Value props:**

1. "From idea to validated concept in one conversation"
2. "Build your app without writing a line of code"
3. "Keep your day job while building your dream"

### What NOT to Say

| Avoid                     | Why                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| "AI-powered SaaS builder" | Target user doesn't know what SaaS means |
| "Low-code platform"       | Still implies technical work             |
| "Startup toolkit"         | Intimidating to dreamers                 |
| "MVP builder"             | Jargon                                   |

### Emotional Hooks

| Emotion            | Message                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frustration**    | "Tired of ideas going nowhere?"                                          |
| **Hope**           | "What if you could finally build that thing you've been thinking about?" |

| **Empowerment**    | "You have the idea. AI handles the rest."                                |

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Wrong Segment

**Mitigation:** Track cohort data rigorously. If corporate side-hustlers don't convert, pivot to next segment quickly.

**Leading indicators of wrong segment:**

- High signup, low activation (<20%)
- Lots of questions about "what can it build?"
- Complaints about missing enterprise features
- Users want to export code

### Risk: Can't Reach Them

**Mitigation:** Build in public on Twitter/X. Founder's constraint (can't use LinkedIn) forces community-building which aligns with target audience behavior.

### Risk: Won't Pay

**Mitigation:** Credit system with generous free tier validates interest before requiring payment. Users who exhaust credits demonstrate real demand.
