# Development Notes

## Q&A Session

Q: What specific technical skills do you have for this project?
A: I have 10 years of embedded systems experience including 3 years with TinyML on ARM Cortex-M processors. I have shipped 2 consumer hardware products previously. My expertise includes firmware development in C/C++, Python for ML model training, and React Native for mobile development.

Q: What is your realistic timeline to MVP?
A: Based on my hardware experience, I estimate 8 months to functional prototype and 14 months to production-ready MVP. This accounts for PCB iterations, firmware development, mobile app, and initial ML model training.

Q: Do you have manufacturing connections?
A: Yes, I have existing relationships with 2 Shenzhen manufacturers from my previous hardware startup. They have quoted competitive pricing for production runs of 5000+ units. I also have contacts at PCB fabrication houses in Shenzhen.

Q: What is your financial runway?
A: I have 18 months of personal runway saved, plus $150k in pre-seed commitments from angel investors who backed my previous startup. Total available capital is approximately $280k.

Q: How much time can you dedicate to this project?
A: I am leaving my full-time job next month to work on this 60+ hours per week. I have no other major commitments or side projects.

Q: What is your competitive moat?
A: Our proprietary TinyML algorithms achieve 40% better battery life than competitors while maintaining accuracy. This is based on novel quantization techniques I developed during my PhD research.

Q: How large is your target market?
A: The global wellness wearables market is $8.5 billion in 2024, growing at 12% CAGR. Our serviceable addressable market targeting tech professionals is approximately $2.1 billion.

Q: What validation have you done?
A: I have conducted 47 customer discovery interviews with target users. 78% expressed strong interest in a device that correlates multiple health metrics automatically. I also ran a landing page test that achieved 12% email signup conversion.
