# Pet Health Monitoring App

## Problem
Pet owners often miss early signs of health issues in their pets because symptoms can be subtle. Veterinary visits are expensive and pets can't communicate their discomfort directly. The global pet care market is valued at $320 billion with pet health tech growing rapidly.

## Solution
An AI-powered mobile app that:
- Analyzes daily photos of pets to detect changes in appearance, posture, or behavior
- Tracks activity levels through phone sensors when near the pet
- Provides early warning alerts for potential health concerns
- Connects to a network of veterinarians for quick consultations

## Target Market
- Pet owners in the US (67% of households own a pet)
- Focus on dog and cat owners initially
- Premium segment willing to pay for pet health technology
- Pet tech market growing to $20B by 2025

## Technology
- Computer vision AI for pet health analysis
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Cloud backend with ML inference

## Competition
- Whistle (GPS + activity tracking)
- Petcube (pet cameras)
- Traditional vet visits
