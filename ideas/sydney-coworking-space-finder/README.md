# DeskNow - Surry Hills Same-Day Workspace

## Executive Summary

DeskNow is a **LOCALIZE** play: adapting the proven instant-booking marketplace model (Uber, OpenTable) to Sydney's underserved same-day coworking segment, starting with Surry Hills.

**Investment:** $2,000 budget | 10 hours/week | 12-month runway
**Target Income:** $12,000/year ($1,000/month) within 3-6 months
**Timing:** URGENT - 6-12 month window before well-resourced competitors recognize this niche

## The Problem: Fragmented Booking Kills Productivity

### Who Experiences This

**Solo founders and early-stage startup operators in Sydney** who split time between home and coworking, seeking affordable day passes in different neighborhoods based on their daily schedule.

This is NOT a problem for everyone—it's a **weekly blocker for power users** who book 3-5 days per week and lose hours monthly to fragmented search and failed bookings.

### The Real Cost

- **Time:** 30-60 minutes per search session checking multiple websites, calling venues, or walking between spaces
- **Money:** For freelancers billing $50-150/hour, this represents **$25-150 in lost productive time per incident**
- **Frustration:** Arriving at an 'available' space only to find it full

### Evidence This Problem Exists

- Informal interviews with 5-10 fellow remote workers confirmed 15-30 minute searches across multiple platforms
- Common feedback: *"I waste 20 minutes calling around to find a desk"* and *"I just give up and work from a noisy café instead"*
- 3 of 5 interviewed freelancers would pay $10-15/month for a reliable real-time aggregator

---

## Solution: The Last-Minute Booking Champion

DeskNow is the **only** Sydney coworking platform that refuses advance bookings. We optimize exclusively for the "I need a desk in the next 2 hours" use case.

### How It Works

1. **Open app** → See available desks in Surry Hills (live-updated every 5 minutes)
2. **Tap to select** → View photos, amenities, price, walk time
3. **Apple Pay** → Confirmed in 3 taps, no account needed
4. **Walk in** → QR code entry, zero reception friction

### Key Differentiators

| What We Do | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Refuse advance bookings** (24hr max) | Forces real-time accuracy competitors can't match |
| **Sub-60-second booking** | Respects users' billable time |
| **Zero friction** (no account required) | Removes every excuse not to book |
| **10% commission** (vs 15-20% industry standard) | Attracts space partners |
| **Hyper-local density** | Creates network effects within walking distance |

### Technical Approach (No-Code MVP)

- **App:** Glide or FlutterFlow for mobile interface
- **Backend:** Airtable as database
- **Payments:** Stripe with Apple Pay/Google Pay
- **Availability:** Simple web dashboard for space operators to update manually

**Cost:** $1,500-2,000 (within $2K budget)

## Target Market: Surry Hills First

### Primary Segment

**Solo founders and early-stage startup operators (1-5 person teams)** who:
- Don't want long-term office leases
- Need professional meeting spaces and hot desks on-demand
- Are cost-conscious and time-poor
- Book spaces last-minute for client meetings or team days
- Split time between home and coworking based on daily schedule

### Why Surry Hills?

- **Highest freelancer density** in Sydney
- **Most independent spaces** (not chains)
- Concentrated in Crown St, Cleveland St, Bourke St corridors
- Freelancer-friendly cafes and culture

### Market Size (Realistic)

- Sydney: 300,000-400,000 remote workers and freelancers
- 'Short-notice booker' segment: 30-40% = 45,000-60,000 users
- Surry Hills initial addressable: ~5,000-10,000 potential users
- Year 1 target: 200-400 weekly bookings

## Competitive Positioning

### We Don't Compete—We Serve the Ignored Segment

| Dimension | DeskNow | WeWork/Hub | Spacely/Office Hub |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Use Case** | "I need a desk NOW" | Monthly memberships | Longer-term rentals |
| **Booking Time** | 60 seconds | Days (inquiry-based) | Request-based |
| **Real-Time Accuracy** | ✅ 5-min updates | ❌ Request-based | ❌ Static listings |
| **First-Time Friction** | Zero (no account) | High (contracts) | Medium |
| **Commission** | 10% | N/A | 15-20% |

### Competitor Weaknesses to Exploit

- Desktop-first websites designed for planned bookings, not spontaneous mobile searches
- Clunky mobile experiences with no location-based "find a desk near me now" functionality
- No single platform shows **what's actually available right now**

---

## Why Now: 6-12 Month Window

1. **Post-COVID Hybrid Permanence** - Remote work normalized, but patterns are spontaneous not scheduled
2. **Sydney Coworking Fragmentation** - 200+ spaces, no dominant booking platform
3. **Independent Space Hunger** - 50+ spaces lack booking infrastructure and resent paying 15-20% to aggregators
4. **Mobile Payment Maturity** - Apple Pay/Google Pay adoption enables frictionless checkout
5. **WeWork Restructuring** - Created space for new players

**URGENT:** Well-resourced competitors (Deskpass, existing aggregators) will recognize this niche. We have 6-12 months to establish position.

## Go-to-Market: Density-First Launch

### Phase 1: Prove the Model (Months 1-3)

**Objective:** Validate willingness to pay with minimal investment

- Build no-code MVP within $2K budget
- Partner with 10+ independent Surry Hills spaces
- Achieve **100 paid bookings** (validation milestone)
- Build reputation for real-time accuracy

**Time Investment:** 10 hours/week
- Week 1-2: MVP build (Glide/Airtable/Stripe)
- Week 3-6: Space partner outreach (15-20 spaces → target 10)
- Week 7-12: Launch, iterate, hit 100 bookings

### Phase 2: Neighborhood Expansion (Months 4-6)

- Expand to Newtown, Pyrmont, Barangaroo
- Target 500 monthly active bookers
- Launch power user subscription ($29/month)

### Phase 3: Sydney-Wide + Switching Costs (Months 7-12)

- Full CBD and inner suburb coverage
- Build switching costs (saved preferences, booking history, credits)
- Evaluate income sustainability vs. $12K target

---

## Revenue Model (Income-Focused)

| Stream | Model | Projected Revenue |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| **Transaction Fee** | 10% per booking | 100 bookings × $30 avg × 10% = $300/month |
| **Power User Sub** | $29/month | 20 subscribers = $580/month |
| **Premium Features** | À la carte | Priority notifications, favorites = $100/month |

### Path to $12K/year Target

| Scenario | Monthly Bookings | Power Users | Monthly Revenue | Annual |
|----------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Conservative | 200 | 10 | $890 | $10,680 |
| **Target** | 300 | 20 | $1,480 | **$17,760** |
| Stretch | 500 | 35 | $2,515 | $30,180 |

**Reality Check:** AI analysis suggests Year 1 mid-case of $9K may fall short of $12K target. Achieving target requires hitting 300+ bookings/month by Month 6.

## Success Metrics & Kill Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Timeframe | Kill Trigger |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Space partners with real-time availability | 10+ | 3 months | <5 partners by Month 3 |
| Paid bookings (validation) | 100 | 3 months | <50 bookings by Month 3 |
| Average booking time | <60 seconds | Launch | >90 seconds |
| Monthly active bookers | 500 | 6 months | <200 by Month 6 |
| Monthly revenue | $1,000 | 6 months | <$500 by Month 6 |

### Kill Conditions (Abandon If:)

1. **Cannot secure 10 space partners by Month 3** - Without real-time availability from operators, core value proposition fails
2. **<50 paid bookings by Month 3** - Insufficient market validation
3. **<$500/month revenue by Month 6** - Not on track for income goals
4. **Commission economics don't work** - Spaces demand >15% or refuse to participate

---

## Key Risks & Mitigations

### Critical Risk (High Severity)

**Risk:** Independent coworking spaces may resist real-time data sharing or demand revenue splits that kill unit economics.

**Mitigation:**
- Lead with value: lower fees (10% vs 15-20%) + demand generation they can't get elsewhere
- Start with 3-5 hungry independent operators, not chains
- Offer simple dashboard (not complex API integration)
- Frame as incremental bookings, not replacement for direct sales

### Execution Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Manual availability updates create operator fatigue | Keep dashboard dead simple; explore automation for Phase 2 |
| Well-resourced competitor enters | First-mover advantage in niche; build switching costs early |
| Users want advance booking | Stay disciplined—it destroys real-time accuracy (core differentiator) |
| Customer support overwhelm at scale | Build self-service tools (FAQ, chatbot) before scaling |

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Revenue doesn't hit $12K target | Diversify revenue (subscriptions, premium features); adjust timeline expectations |
| Validation budget exhausted early | Start with free/organic marketing; paid ads only after model proven |
| Unit economics don't work | Kill at Month 3 if commission per booking < customer acquisition cost |

---

## Personal Alignment

### Why This Fits

- **Goal alignment:** Income-focused, clear monetization paths
- **Time constraint:** 10hr/week is achievable with no-code approach
- **Risk tolerance:** Moderate risk with $2K investment; can afford to fail
- **Skills match:** Mobile app development, API integration, location services
- **Runway:** 12 months part-time while maintaining current income

### Honest Self-Assessment

- I don't have deep passion for coworking specifically—motivated by clear market gap and path to revenue
- No existing community connections in coworking (gap to address)
- Not certain I'd commit 5+ years—treat as income project that could be sold/pivoted
- Haven't personally experienced this problem (relying on network validation)

## Decision Framework

**Proceed if by Month 3:**
- ✅ 10+ space partners
- ✅ 100+ paid bookings
- ✅ Revenue trajectory toward $500+/month

**Pause/Pivot if by Month 3:**
- ❌ <5 space partners (supply problem)
- ❌ <50 bookings (demand problem)

**Kill if by Month 6:**
- ❌ <$500/month revenue
- ❌ Unable to see path to $1,000/month
