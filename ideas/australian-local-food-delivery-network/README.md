# Australian Local Food Delivery Network

## Problem

Australian consumers want access to fresh, local food from nearby restaurants, farms, and specialty producers, but existing platforms like Uber Eats and DoorDash focus primarily on chain restaurants and don't highlight local Australian businesses. There's a gap in the market for a platform that celebrates and supports local Australian food producers.

## Solution

A mobile-first delivery platform specifically designed for the Australian market that:

1. **Hyperlocal Focus**: Partners exclusively with local Australian restaurants, farmers markets, and specialty food producers within a 30km radius
2. **Australian-First Features**: Integration with Australian payment systems (Afterpay, BPAY), local logistics partners, and compliance with Australian food safety regulations
3. **Community Features**: Supports local food festivals, markets, and events in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth
4. **Sustainability**: Electric vehicle delivery fleet and reusable packaging to meet Australian environmental standards

## Target Market

- Primary: Urban Australian millennials and Gen Z in Sydney and Melbourne (initial launch cities)
- Secondary: Health-conscious families seeking fresh, local produce
- Estimated 2 million potential users in greater Sydney area alone

## Competition

- **Local**: Menulog (owned by Just Eat), DoorDash Australia, Uber Eats Australia
- **Indirect**: Woolworths delivery, Coles Online, local farmers market apps

## Business Model

- 15% commission from restaurants (lower than Uber Eats' 30%)
- $4.99 AUD delivery fee
- Premium subscription ($12.99 AUD/month) for free delivery

## Why Now?

Post-COVID, Australians have shown strong preference for supporting local businesses. The Australian food delivery market is projected to reach $7.2 billion AUD by 2026.
