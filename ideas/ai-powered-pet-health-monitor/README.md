# AI-Powered Pet Health Monitor

## Problem

Pet owners struggle to detect health issues in their pets early. By the time symptoms become visible, conditions are often advanced and expensive to treat. The global pet care market is worth over $320 billion, with pet health monitoring being a fast-growing segment.

## Solution

PetHealth AI is a smart collar with embedded sensors that continuously monitors:
- Heart rate and heart rate variability
- Activity levels and sleep patterns
- Temperature and respiratory rate
- GPS location tracking

The companion mobile app uses machine learning to analyze this data and:
- Detect anomalies that may indicate illness
- Provide personalized nutrition and exercise recommendations
- Send alerts when veterinary attention may be needed
- Track long-term health trends

## Target Market

- Pet owners in the US and Europe (180+ million households)
- Focus on dogs and cats initially
- Premium segment: owners willing to pay $150-300 for device + $10/month subscription

## Competition

- Whistle (GPS + basic activity tracking)
- FitBark (activity monitoring for dogs)
- PetPace (veterinary-grade monitoring, $300+)
- Invoxia (GPS tracker with health features)

## Differentiation

Our AI-powered health prediction engine goes beyond simple activity tracking to provide actionable health insights. Partnership with veterinary networks for seamless care coordination.
