# Concurrent Task Database Validation

> **Location:** `docs/specs/CONCURRENT-TASK-VALIDATION.md`
> **Purpose:** Specification for concurrent task creation validation in the parent-harness orchestrator
> **Status:** Test Infrastructure
> **Task ID:** `concurrent_1770382500598_4` (and siblings `_0` through `_3`)

## 1. Overview

### What

The concurrent task validation system ensures that the parent-harness orchestrator's task database layer can reliably handle multiple simultaneous task creation operations without data corruption, lost writes, or constraint violations.

### Why

The orchestrator runs multiple agents in parallel via wave-based execution. When multiple agents complete or create tasks simultaneously, the database must handle concurrent writes safely. This validation exists as part of the E2E honest-validation test suite to prove the system works under concurrent load.

### Origin

Tasks `concurrent_1770382500598_0` through `concurrent_1770382500598_4` are **test artifacts** generated by `parent-harness/orchestrator/tests/e2e/honest-validation.test.ts` in the "Concurrent Access" test group. They are not user-facing feature requests.

---

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Concurrent Task Creation**: The database layer (`parent-harness/orchestrator/src/db/tasks.ts`) must support creating 5+ tasks simultaneously via `Promise.all()` without errors.

2. **Unique ID Generation**: Each concurrently-created task must receive a unique `id` (UUID) and `display_id`, even when created within the same millisecond.

3. **Data Integrity**: All task fields (title, category, priority, status) must be correctly persisted for every concurrently-created task.

4. **No Silent Failures**: Every `createTask()` call in a concurrent batch must either succeed with a valid task record or throw an explicit error - no silent data loss.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Latency**: Concurrent creation of 5 tasks should complete within 5 seconds on the target SQLite database.

2. **Isolation**: SQLite WAL mode must handle concurrent writes without `SQLITE_BUSY` errors propagating to callers.

3. **Idempotency**: Re-running the test suite must not create duplicate tasks or violate unique constraints.

---

## 3. Technical Design

### Test Implementation

The validation is implemented in the E2E test suite:

**File:** `parent-harness/orchestrator/tests/e2e/honest-validation.test.ts`

```typescript
describe('Concurrent Access', () => {
  test('multiple tasks can be created concurrently', async () => {
    const promises = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      promises.push(
        Promise.resolve(
          tasks.createTask({
            display_id: `concurrent_${Date.now()}_${i}`,
            title: `Concurrent Task ${i}`,
            category: 'test',
            priority: 'P2',
          })
        )
      );
    }

    const results = await Promise.all(promises);
    expect(results.length).toBe(5);
    expect(results.every(t => t && t.id)).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Database Layer

The `tasks.createTask()` function in `parent-harness/orchestrator/src/db/tasks.ts` handles:
- UUID generation for `id`
- Timestamp assignment for `created_at`
- Default status of `pending`
- SQLite INSERT with proper error handling

### SQLite Concurrency Model

SQLite uses WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode configured in the parent-harness database:
- WAL allows concurrent reads during writes
- Writes are serialized but fast (microseconds for small inserts)
- `SQLITE_BUSY` timeout is configured to retry automatically

## 4. Pass Criteria

**PASS** when ALL of the following are true:

| # | Criterion | How to Verify |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | 5 tasks created concurrently | `results.length === 5` |
| 2 | All tasks have valid IDs | `results.every(t => t && t.id) === true` |
| 3 | No duplicate IDs | `new Set(results.map(t => t.id)).size === 5` |
| 4 | All tasks retrievable | Each task can be fetched by ID after creation |
| 5 | Correct field values | Each task has expected title, category, priority |

**FAIL** if any criterion is not met.

### Validation Command

```bash
cd parent-harness/orchestrator && npx vitest run tests/e2e/honest-validation.test.ts --reporter=verbose 2>&1 | grep -A5 "Concurrent"
```

## 5. Dependencies

### Depends On

| Dependency | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `parent-harness/orchestrator/src/db/tasks.ts` | Task CRUD operations |
| `parent-harness/database/schema.sql` | Tasks table schema |
| SQLite WAL mode | Concurrent write support |
| Vitest | Test framework |

### Affects

| Component | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Wave execution system | Validates that parallel wave tasks can be created safely |
| Agent spawner | Validates that multiple agents can register tasks concurrently |
| Task API | Validates underlying database layer for concurrent API requests |

---

## 6. Open Questions

| # | Question | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Should concurrent tests clean up after themselves? | Open - currently test tasks persist in DB |
| 2 | Should we test higher concurrency (10+, 50+ tasks)? | Open - current test uses 5 tasks |
| 3 | Should we add stress testing for concurrent updates (not just creates)? | Open - only creation is tested |
