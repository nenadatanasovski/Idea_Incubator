## Summary

Implement work redistribution when an agent fails or becomes overloaded. Ensures tasks continue progressing even when agents have issues.

---

## Requirements

1. **Load Monitoring**:
   - Track agent workloads
   - Detect overloaded agents
   - Identify available capacity

2. **Redistribution Logic**:
   - Move tasks from overloaded agents
   - Assign to agents with capacity
   - Maintain priorities

3. **Failure Handling**:
   - Detect agent failures
   - Reassign pending tasks
   - Preserve task state

## Pass Criteria

| # | Criterion | How to Verify |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Load monitored | Check metrics |
| 2 | Redistribution works | Test with overload |
| 3 | Failure handled | Test agent failure |
