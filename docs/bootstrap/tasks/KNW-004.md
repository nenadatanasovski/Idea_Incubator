## Summary

Implement confidence scoring for knowledge entries. Confidence increases when gotchas prevent errors and decreases with time or contradicting evidence.

---

## Requirements

1. **Initial Confidence**:
   - Set based on extraction quality
   - Consider source reliability
   - Start modest (0.5-0.7)

2. **Confidence Updates**:
   - Boost on successful prevention
   - Decay over time
   - Reduce on contradiction

3. **Threshold Management**:
   - Minimum for queries (0.5)
   - Promotion threshold (0.9)
   - Archive threshold (0.2)

## Pass Criteria

| #   | Criterion             | How to Verify              |
| --- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | Initial scoring works | Create entry, check        |
| 2   | Boosts work           | Apply, verify increase     |
| 3   | Decay works           | Age entry, verify decrease |
