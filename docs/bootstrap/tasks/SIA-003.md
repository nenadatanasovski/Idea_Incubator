## Metadata

| Field          | Value                      |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Phase**      | 9 - Self-Improvement Agent |
| **Depends On** | SIA-002                    |

## Summary

Implement the execution analyzer that reviews Build Agent task executions and identifies patterns, failures, and opportunities for learning.

---

## Context

### Analysis Scope

| Aspect                 | What to Analyze           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Success patterns**   | What worked well          |
| **Failure patterns**   | What went wrong           |
| **Duration anomalies** | Tasks that took too long  |
| **Retry patterns**     | Tasks that needed retries |

---

## Requirements

1. **Execution Loading**:
   - Query task execution history
   - Load associated context
   - Group by outcome type

2. **Pattern Detection**:
   - Identify common success factors
   - Identify common failure causes
   - Detect recurring issues

3. **Analysis Output**:
   - Structured analysis report
   - Confidence scores
   - Actionable insights

## Pass Criteria

| #   | Criterion         | How to Verify          |
| --- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1   | Executions loaded | Query returns data     |
| 2   | Patterns detected | Output shows patterns  |
| 3   | Confidence scored | Each finding has score |

## Code Template

```typescript
interface ExecutionAnalysis {
  executionId: string;
  outcome: "success" | "failure" | "partial";
  patterns: Pattern[];
  anomalies: Anomaly[];
  insights: Insight[];
}

export async function analyzeExecution(
  executionId: string,
): Promise<ExecutionAnalysis> {
  // Load execution details
  // Analyze patterns
  // Generate insights
}
```
