## Summary

Run the system autonomously for 7 days with minimal human intervention. Track interventions required and success metrics to validate autonomous capability.

---

## Requirements

1. **Test Setup**:
   - Configure monitoring
   - Set alert thresholds
   - Prepare test workload

2. **Test Execution**:
   - Run system continuously
   - Log all activity
   - Track interventions

3. **Success Metrics**:
   - < 3 human interventions
   - > 95% task success rate
   - No data loss
   - No security incidents

## Pass Criteria

| #   | Criterion            | How to Verify    |
| --- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | 7 days elapsed       | Check timestamps |
| 2   | < 3 interventions    | Count logs       |
| 3   | > 95% success        | Calculate rate   |
| 4   | No critical failures | Review alerts    |
