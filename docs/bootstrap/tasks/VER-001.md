## Summary

Use Spec Agent to generate its own specification. This is a key self-consistency test - the agent that generates specs must be able to spec itself accurately.

---

## Requirements

1. **Self-Specification**:
   - Spec Agent generates spec for Spec Agent
   - Compare to original implementation
   - Identify gaps or improvements

2. **Quality Check**:
   - Generated spec is complete
   - Tasks are implementable
   - No circular dependencies

## Pass Criteria

| #   | Criterion               | How to Verify           |
| --- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1   | Self-spec generated     | File exists             |
| 2   | Spec is accurate        | Manual review           |
| 3   | Could rebuild from spec | Assess implementability |
