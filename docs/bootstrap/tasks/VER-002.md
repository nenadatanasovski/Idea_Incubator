| Field          | Value                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Phase**      | 13 - Verification & Autonomy |
| **Depends On** | VER-001, BLD-009             |

## Summary

Perform triple-build verification: use self-generated spec to rebuild the system, then verify the rebuilt system produces equivalent output.

---

## Context

### Triple Build Process

```
Build 1: Original (human + Claude Code)
         ↓
Build 2: Rebuilt from self-spec
         ↓
Build 3: Rebuilt from Build 2's spec
         ↓
Verify: Build 2 output ≈ Build 3 output
```

---

## Requirements

1. **Build 2**:
   - Use self-generated spec
   - Build Agent implements
   - Produces new system

2. **Build 3**:
   - Build 2 generates spec
   - Build Agent implements
   - Produces another system

3. **Verification**:
   - Compare spec outputs
   - Compare implementations
   - Report differences

---

## Pass Criteria

| #   | Criterion        | How to Verify |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Build 2 succeeds | Tests pass    |
| 2   | Build 3 succeeds | Tests pass    |
| 3   | Outputs match    | Diff < 5%     |
