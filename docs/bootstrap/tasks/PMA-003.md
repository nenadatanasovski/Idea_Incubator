## Summary

Implement conflict resolution logic for when multiple agents need the same resource (file, API quota, etc.).

---

## Requirements

1. **Conflict Detection**:
   - Monitor resource requests
   - Detect overlapping claims
   - Identify deadlock potential

2. **Resolution Strategies**:
   - Priority-based (higher priority wins)
   - Time-based (first request wins)
   - Negotiated (agents coordinate)

3. **Escalation**:
   - Escalate unresolvable conflicts
   - Notify human if needed

## Pass Criteria

| #   | Criterion          | How to Verify                |
| --- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1   | Conflicts detected | Test with competing requests |
| 2   | Resolution works   | Verify resolution strategy   |
| 3   | Escalation works   | Test unresolvable conflict   |
