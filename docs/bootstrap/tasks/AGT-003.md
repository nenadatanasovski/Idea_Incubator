## Summary

Document exactly what Spec Agent v0.1 can and cannot do. Prevents scope creep and provides clear acceptance criteria.

---

## Requirements

1. **CAN Do Section** (15+ items):
   - Input processing capabilities
   - Claude integration features
   - Output generation formats
   - Gotcha handling
   - User interaction patterns

2. **CANNOT Do Section** (10+ items):
   - Knowledge Base integration (deferred)
   - Complex analysis features
   - Advanced features
   - Self-improvement capabilities

3. **Quality Bar**:
   - Template compliance: 100%
   - YAML validity: 100%
   - Task atomicity: 100%
   - Gotcha relevance: 80%
   - Implementability: 80%

## Pass Criteria

**PASS** when ALL of the following are true:

| #   | Criterion              | How to Verify                                                                   |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Scope file exists      | `test -f docs/bootstrap/SPEC-AGENT-V01-SCOPE.md` returns 0                      |
| 2   | Has 15+ CAN items      | `grep -c "✓" docs/bootstrap/SPEC-AGENT-V01-SCOPE.md` >= 15                      |
| 3   | Has 10+ CANNOT items   | `grep -c "✗" docs/bootstrap/SPEC-AGENT-V01-SCOPE.md` >= 10                      |
| 4   | Has Quality Bar table  | `grep -q "Quality Bar" docs/bootstrap/SPEC-AGENT-V01-SCOPE.md` returns 0        |
| 5   | Has Success Definition | `grep -q "Success Looks Like" docs/bootstrap/SPEC-AGENT-V01-SCOPE.md` returns 0 |

**FAIL** if any criterion is not met.

## Output Files

```
docs/bootstrap/
└── SPEC-AGENT-V01-SCOPE.md
```

---

## Validation

```bash
# Check file exists
test -f docs/bootstrap/SPEC-AGENT-V01-SCOPE.md && echo "OK"

# Count CAN items (lines starting with number and checkmark)
grep -c "✓" docs/bootstrap/SPEC-AGENT-V01-SCOPE.md

# Count CANNOT items
grep -c "✗" docs/bootstrap/SPEC-AGENT-V01-SCOPE.md
```
