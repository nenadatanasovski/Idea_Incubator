I've created a comprehensive MVP feature list for the pet health tracking mobile app. Here's a summary of what's included:

## MVP Feature List Created

**Location:** `ideas/ai-powered-pet-health-monitor/mvp-features.md`

### Key Highlights:

**Core MVP Features (P0 - Must Have):**

1. **Pet Profile Management** - Create/edit pet profiles with breed, weight, age
2. **Health Logging** - Weight tracking, symptom logging, medication tracker
3. **Reminders & Notifications** - Medication reminders, vaccination alerts
4. **Health Dashboard** - At-a-glance summary with trends
5. **User Accounts** - Authentication, cloud sync, notification settings

**Deliberately Deferred:**

- Smart collar hardware integration
- Real-time vital monitoring
- Advanced AI health predictions
- Veterinary network integration

### MVP Timeline: 3-4 months across 4 phases

1. Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
2. Core Health Features (Weeks 5-8)
3. Polish & Launch (Weeks 9-12)
4. Post-MVP Iteration (Weeks 13-16)

### Success Metrics:

- 5,000 downloads in first month
- 40% Day-7 retention
- 3+ health entries per user per week
- 4.0+ app store rating

### Strategic Positioning:

The MVP focuses on **manual health tracking** (weight, symptoms, medications, vet visits) rather than hardware-dependent features. This validates market demand at low cost before investing in the smart collar hardware.

**Next Steps to Consider:**

1. Run `/idea-evaluate` to score this against the 30 criteria
2. Run `/idea-develop` to flesh out open questions (monetization, target user specifics)
3. Run `/idea-redteam` to challenge assumptions about user willingness to manually log data

Would you like me to proceed with any of these, or refine specific sections of the MVP feature list?
