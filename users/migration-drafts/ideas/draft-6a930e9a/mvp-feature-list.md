I can see there's already a comprehensive MVP feature list document created on 2026-01-05. This is a well-structured and thorough document that covers:

## Existing MVP Feature List Summary

**The MVP feature list artifact already exists and is comprehensive.** Would you like me to:

1. **Update/enhance** the existing document with additional details?
2. **Create a simplified version** (e.g., one-page summary)?
3. **Add a specific section** (e.g., API endpoints, wireframe descriptions)?
4. **Move to evaluation** by running `/idea-evaluate` against this idea?
