# FridgeScan — Elevator Pitch

## The Problem
Every week, Australian households throw away $1,000+ worth of food annually. The culprit? The daily "what's for dinner" paralysis combined with forgotten ingredients buried in the back of the fridge.

## The Solution
**FridgeScan** uses computer vision to instantly identify what's in your fridge, then suggests personalized recipes based on what you actually have — not what you wish you had.

## How It Works
1. **Snap** — Take a photo of your fridge contents
2. **Scan** — AI identifies ingredients automatically
3. **Suggest** — Get recipes ranked by ingredient match, dietary preferences, and time available
4. **Save** — Track what you use, reduce waste, discover new meals

## Why Now
- CV technology has matured (GPT-4V, Claude Vision, on-device ML)
- Cost of living pressures making food waste a hot-button issue
- Recipe apps have stagnated — manual input friction kills engagement

## Why This Team
Ned brings 10 years of app development experience plus hands-on computer vision expertise — the exact skillset needed to nail the technical differentiator.

## The Ask
Looking for early users willing to test the fridge-scanning experience and provide feedback on recipe matching accuracy.
