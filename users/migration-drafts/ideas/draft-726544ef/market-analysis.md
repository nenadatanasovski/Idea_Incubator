I see that the "AI-powered fridge recipe scanner" is the only recipe-related idea in the system, and it already has a comprehensive market analysis. The user's request for "An AI-powered recipe app" likely refers to this same idea, or they may want to create a new, more generic AI recipe app.

Since the context mentions "An AI-powered recipe app" which could be a new, broader concept (not specifically fridge-scanning), I should ask the user for clarification before proceeding.

I notice there's already a comprehensive market analysis for the "AI-powered fridge recipe scanner" idea. Your request is for "An AI-powered recipe app" - before I create a new artifact, I have a question:

**Are you referring to:**

1. **The existing idea** - "AI-powered fridge recipe scanner" (which already has a detailed market analysis I can update/expand)

2. **A new, different idea** - A general AI-powered recipe app (perhaps without the fridge scanning feature, or with different core functionality)

If it's option 1, the existing market analysis is quite comprehensive (updated January 2026) and covers:
- Market size: $5.5B recipe apps market, $972M AI meal planning segment (28% CAGR)
- Competitive landscape (SuperCook, Yummly, Whisk, Tasty, etc.)
- Target demographics (40% aged 18-34, 70% female)
- Revenue models and pricing benchmarks
- SWOT analysis and go-to-market recommendations

I could either:
- Create a summary/executive brief
- Add additional sections (specific geographic analysis, updated competitor deep-dive, etc.)
- Create a fresh perspective with different angles

If it's option 2, please tell me more about the specific AI recipe app concept so I can tailor the market analysis appropriately.
