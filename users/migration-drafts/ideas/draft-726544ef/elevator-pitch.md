I'd be happy to help you create a refined and compelling pitch! However, I don't see any specific idea or context provided for me to work with.

Could you please share:

1. **The idea you want me to pitch** - What is it? What problem does it solve?
2. **The target audience** - Who are you pitching to? (investors, customers, partners, etc.)
3. **Any existing materials** - Do you have an idea file I should read? (e.g., `ideas/[your-idea-slug]/README.md`)

Alternatively, if you have an idea already captured in the Idea Incubator system, just tell me the idea slug and I can read it to create the pitch. For example:
- "Create a pitch for `my-saas-idea`"
- "Refine the pitch for the idea in `ideas/ai-assistant/`"

What would you like me to pitch?
