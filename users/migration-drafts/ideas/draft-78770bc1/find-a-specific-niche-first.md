I'll help you narrow down the niche for the AI Resume Screening Tool. Let me first review the current state of this idea and then ask some targeted questions to help define the niche better.

Based on the context, I can see:

- **Current Status**: Forming (23% confidence)
- **Viability**: 75%
- **Key Risks Identified**:
  - No market data found (HIGH)
  - Target customer not clearly defined (MEDIUM)

The idea addresses a real pain point (recruiters struggling with accuracy, usability, integrations, and cost of existing tools), but we need to narrow down WHO specifically and WHAT specific problem variant.

## Niching Questions for AI Resume Screening Tool

Let me ask you some targeted questions to help define a defensible niche:

### 1. **Company Size / Type**

Who do you see as the ideal customer?

| Option                                    | Characteristics                                  | Why it matters                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **SMB Recruiters** (10-200 employees)     | No dedicated ATS, limited budget, 1-3 recruiters | Simpler needs, faster sales, but price-sensitive |
| **Mid-Market** (200-2000 employees)       | Have ATS, dedicated HR team, volume hiring       | More budget, but need integrations               |
| **Enterprise** (2000+)                    | Complex workflows, compliance needs              | High contract values, long sales cycles          |
| **Staffing Agencies**                     | High volume, multiple clients, speed critical    | Different workflow than in-house                 |
| **RPO (Recruitment Process Outsourcing)** | Manage hiring for others                         | Sophisticated needs, bulk deals                  |

### 2. **Industry Vertical**

Is there a specific industry where you've observed the pain most acutely?

- **Tech hiring** (engineers, PMs) — crowded space, but high volume
- **Healthcare** (nurses, techs) — credential verification critical
- **Retail/Hospitality** — high-volume, low-skill, high turnover
- **Financial Services** — compliance-heavy
- **Manufacturing/Blue Collar** — different skill matching needs
- **Other**: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***

### 3. **The "Job to be Done"**

Which specific pain point should we focus on solving FIRST?

| Pain Point               | Example Scenario                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Volume Overwhelm**     | "We get 500 resumes per role and can't review them all"         |
| **Quality Matching**     | "We miss good candidates because keywords don't capture nuance" |
| **Speed**                | "Good candidates accept other offers before we respond"         |
| **Bias Reduction**       | "We want more diverse candidate pools"                          |
| **Integration Friction** | "Current tools don't talk to our ATS/HRIS"                      |
| **Cost**                 | "Enterprise tools are $50k+/year, we need something affordable" |

### 4. **Your Unfair Advantage**

What gives YOU a unique angle here?

- Do you have recruiting experience yourself?
- Access to a specific recruiter community?
- Technical expertise in NLP/ML that's differentiated?
- Connections to a specific industry vertical?
- Insight into a failed competitor's mistakes?

## Quick Niche Hypothesis Generator

Based on your answers, I can help you form a hypothesis like:

> **"An AI resume screening tool for [COMPANY SIZE] in [INDUSTRY] that solves [SPECIFIC PAIN] by [UNIQUE APPROACH]"**
