Before I start building the prototype, I need to understand what you're looking for. Let me ask a few clarifying questions:

## 🔧 Prototyping Options for AI Resume Screening Tool

### What type of prototype do you want?

| Option                    | Description                                           | Effort    | Cost            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------------- |
| **A) Functional MVP**     | Working web app with real AI-powered resume screening | 2-3 hours | ~$2-5 API costs |
| **B) Interactive Mockup** | Clickable UI showing the recruiter flow (no AI)       | 1-2 hours | Free            |
| **C) Proof of Concept**   | CLI script demonstrating resume-to-job matching       | 30 min    | ~$1 API cost    |
| **D) Landing Page**       | Marketing page to validate interest before building   | 1 hour    | Free            |

### What's the core feature to demonstrate?

1. **Resume Screening** - AI analyzes resumes against job requirements, scores/ranks candidates
2. **Candidate Matching** - Upload job description, find best matches from resume pool
3. **ATS Integration Demo** - Show how it would plug into existing recruiting tools
4. **Full Workflow** - End-to-end from job posting to candidate shortlist

---

**My recommendation:** Start with **Option C (Proof of Concept)** focusing on **Resume Screening**. This lets you:

- Validate the core AI logic works well
- Test with real resumes and job descriptions
- Iterate quickly before building UI
- Demonstrate value to potential users

Should I proceed with this, or would you prefer a different approach? Just reply with your choice (e.g., "A with feature 2" or "go with your recommendation").
