## Research Complete!

I've conducted comprehensive market research on the **AI Resume Screening Tool** idea. Here's what I found:

---

## Key Findings

### The Market is Real & Growing
- **$617-661M** market in 2024-2025, growing to **$1.56B by 2037** (7.4% CAGR)
- **83% of companies** will use AI resume screening by 2025
- Strong investor interest: Mercor just raised $100M at $2B valuation

### The Pain Points Are Validated
Your observation is correct — recruiters **have tools but still struggle**:

| Pain Point | Evidence |
|------------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | 88% of employers believe ATS screens out qualified candidates |
| **Bias** | 85% of AI screeners prefer white-associated names; major lawsuits underway |
| **Integration** | Top complaint — tools don't connect to LinkedIn, HRIS, job boards properly |
| **Cost** | Enterprise tools expensive; SMB tools lacking |
| **Arms Race** | AI candidates vs. AI screeners = volume without quality |

### Competitive Landscape
- **Fragmented**: Top 10 vendors hold only 51% of market
- **Enterprise leaders**: iCIMS, Workday, Greenhouse, Lever
- **AI challengers**: Eightfold ($424M raised), Mercor ($2B valuation)
- **SMB gap**: Budget tools ($30-75/mo) are weak; premium tools ($299+/mo) too expensive

### Major Risk: Regulatory Wave
- **40+ states** have introduced AI employment bills
- **EEOC actively suing** vendors (Workday class action certified May 2025)
- **Colorado AI Act** and **California regulations** (Oct 2025) set precedent
- This is both a risk AND an opportunity (compliance-first positioning)

## Opportunity Areas

1. **Compliance-first**: Build for the regulatory wave before it hits
2. **SMB sweet spot**: $75-149/month gap in market
3. **Integration depth**: Do 10 integrations perfectly vs. 500 poorly  
4. **Explainable AI**: Transparent scoring vs. black-box competitors
5. **Accuracy focus**: Measurable improvement metrics

## Questions to Clarify

Before evaluating further, consider:

1. **Who exactly?** SMB recruiters, mid-market HR, or staffing agencies?
2. **What's the wedge?** Compliance? Price? Accuracy? Integration?
3. **Build what?** Full ATS, screening-only tool, or integration layer?
4. **Why will your AI be better?** Technical differentiation needed
