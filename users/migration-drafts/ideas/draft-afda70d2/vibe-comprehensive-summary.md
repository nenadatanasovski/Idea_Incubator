# Vibe — Complete Idea Summary

**One-liner:** An AI-powered platform that transforms ideas into AI-managed SaaS products through guided ideation, automated building, and proactive networking.

**Status:** Ideation (MVP in progress)
**Location:** Sydney, Australia
**Founder:** Ned (10 years app development)

---

## The Vision

Vibe democratizes entrepreneurship by removing technical barriers between having an idea and having a working product. It's not just a builder — it's a continuous AI partner.

**Name Origin:** **V**alidation, **I**deation, **B**uilding, **E**cosystem + "your vibe becomes matter"

## The Three Pillars

| Pillar       | What It Does                                        | AI Role                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Ideation** | Vague idea → validated, spec'd concept              | Ask → Analyze → Clarify → Guide       |
| **Building** | AI generates apps with full ideation context        | Ralph loop + human-in-the-loop        |
| **Network**  | Proactive connections, collaborators, opportunities | Continuous engagement across channels |

---

## Revenue Model

| Stream          | Mechanism                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Hosting + DB    | Base cost + margin                   |
| Feature Garden  | Monthly fee per feature              |
| Custom Features | Credits for AI work                  |
| Revenue Share   | Optional (Vibe Payments only)        |
| Paid Testing    | Creators pay testers, Vibe takes fee |

**No escape hatch:** Users own app, not code. Platform Continuity clause allows code purchase if shutdown.

---

## Target User

"Dreamers who don't have time to structurally plan, think, ideate, build, publish, and network on their own — but want to finally do something for themselves."

---

## Autonomous Agent System (Core Differentiator)

### Key Components

- **Agents as Vehicles** — Containerized instances, replicable as needed
- **Self-Learning** — Track records inform future behavior
- **Self-Improvement Agent (SIA)** — Meta-agent that improves other agents
- **Orchestrator** — Routes requests, spawns new agent types
- **Deterministic Pipelines** — Stage gates with pass/fail criteria

### Circuit Breakers

- Max attempts before human escalation
- Credit limits prevent runaway costs
- Impossible task detection at assignment

### Self-Optimization Engine

Testing agents with browser control simulate users, capture friction, auto-fix simple issues.

---

## Competitive Position

**Market:** $28.75B (2024) → $264B (2032), 32.2% CAGR

**Whitespace:** All competitors assume user knows what to build. None guide ideation → build → network as unified experience.

**Moat:**

1. Business intelligence in conversation (invisible)
2. Context handoff ideation → build
3. Proactive continuous AI
4. Self-optimizing platform
5. "Never see code" lock-in
6. Self-Improvement Agent (SIA)

## Skeptic Challenges Addressed

| Challenge                      | Response                                 |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| SIA improvements hallucinated  | Deterministic pass/fail criteria         |
| Context handoffs lose nuance   | Git history + transcripts                |
| Lock-in is predatory           | Liberation + Platform Continuity clause  |
| Revenue share unenforceable    | Optional Vibe Payments only              |
| Network requires critical mass | Feature Garden provides standalone value |
| AI can't solve everything      | Human-in-the-loop for edge cases         |

---

## Retention Tactics

1. Network lock-in (cross-app discovery)
2. Continuous AI improvement
3. Data/analytics lock-in
4. Community relationships
5. Cost of recreation
6. Technical liberation

---

## Go-to-Market

**Constraints:** 15-20 hrs/week, $100K AUD savings, no LinkedIn

**Channels:** Twitter/X, Reddit, Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, Referrals

**Sequence:**

1. Bootstrap MVP (2-4 months)
2. Private beta (friends/family)
3. Soft launch (organic channels)
4. Product Hunt burst
5. Iterate + grow
6. Raise when signals align

**Full-time triggers:** 10+ paying strangers, $2-5K/month, 40%+ retention, 500+ waitlist

---

## Immediate Priorities

### Next 30 Days

1. Ideation agent system
2. Multi-agent orchestration
3. Hosting capability (if time permits)

### 60-Day Horizon

- Specification agent
- Build agent with Ralph loop
- First external users

### 90-Day Horizon

- End-to-end demo
- 10-20 users beyond inner circle
- Product Hunt preparation

---

## Overall Assessment

**Viable idea with significant execution risk.**

**Critical success factors:**

1. Execute fast (6-12 month window)
2. Learn faster than well-funded competitors
3. Find co-founder soon
4. Build in public for attention moat

**The Real Fear:** Someone beats Vibe to market with more capital.

**Response:** Can't out-capital them. Must out-focus and out-iterate.
