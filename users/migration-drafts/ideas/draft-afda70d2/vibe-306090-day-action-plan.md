## Parallel Tracks

### Co-Founder Search (Ongoing from Day 1)

| Week | Activity                                                                          |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-4  | Passive: Lurk in Indie Hackers, Twitter startup circles. Note interesting people. |
| 5-8  | Semi-active: Engage with potential fits. Share Vibe progress.                     |
| 9-12 | Active: Reach out to 2-3 candidates with demo. Explore fit.                       |

**Profile sought:**

- Product/growth skills (if Ned is orchestration-focused)
- Entrepreneurial mindset (not employee seeking equity)
- Comfortable with AI-native workflows
- Existing network in startup/creator communities

**Where to look:**

- Indie Hackers
- On Deck
- Y Combinator co-founder matching
- Twitter/X startup circles
- Former colleagues

### Build in Public (2-3 hrs/week)

| Week | Content                                                  |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | "Starting Vibe — here's the vision"                      |
| 2    | "Built the orchestrator this week — here's how it works" |
| 3    | "The SIA is alive — agents improving themselves"         |
| 4    | "First friend tested Vibe — here's what I learned"       |
| 5-8  | Weekly progress updates                                  |
| 9-12 | Demo videos, beta user testimonials                      |

## Risk Mitigations

| Risk                     | Mitigation                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope creep**          | Ruthless prioritization. Each week has ONE primary goal.     |
| **Feature rabbit holes** | Timebox exploration to 2 hours max. Ship imperfect, iterate. |
| **Burnout**              | 15-20 hrs/week is the ceiling, not the floor. Rest matters.  |
| **Technical blockers**   | Human-in-the-loop is a feature, not failure. Ask for help.   |
| **No traction**          | If Month 3 has <5 external users, revisit positioning.       |
