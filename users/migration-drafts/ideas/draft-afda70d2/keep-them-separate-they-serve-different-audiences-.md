I've reviewed the comprehensive Vibe documentation. This is an impressively well-developed idea! Based on the current state and the identified risks (market may be too vague, target customer not clearly defined), let me help flesh out the idea through some clarifying questions.

## 🎯 Idea Development: Vibe

Your idea is already quite mature with strong documentation. However, looking at the viability assessment, there are two key risks to address:

1. **HIGH**: "No market data found - market may not exist or idea is too vague"
2. **MEDIUM**: "Target customer not clearly defined"

Let me ask **3 clarifying questions** that will help sharpen the concept and reduce these risks:

---

### Question 1: Target Customer Prioritization

Your README mentions 5 persona types (solopreneurs, corporate employees, small business owners, creators, retired professionals). While "launch broad, measure who engages" is a valid strategy, the current risk assessment suggests the target is too vague for validation.

**Which ONE persona would you bet on for your first 10 paying customers?**

| Persona | Buying Signal | Typical Pain |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Aspiring solopreneurs** | Follow Indie Hackers, build-in-public Twitter | Can't code, overwhelmed by options |
| **Corporate side-hustlers** | Limited time (10-15 hrs/week), stable income | No bandwidth to learn tech stack |
| **Small business owners** | Already paying for custom dev that's slow | Frustration with agencies/freelancers |
| **Creators** | 10K+ audience, no product yet | Audience but no monetization beyond ads |
| **Retired professionals** | Domain expertise, time, capital | Tech intimidation despite knowledge |

**Why this matters:** Your GTM channels, messaging, and Feature Garden priorities depend on this choice.

### Question 2: Competitive Moat Timeline

You've identified that the window is "6-12 months" before well-funded competitors could replicate. Your autonomous agent system (SIA loops) is sophisticated, but:

**What's the ONE defensible element that will take competitors the longest to replicate?**

Options from your documentation:
1. **The ideation → build context handoff** (no one does this seamlessly)
2. **The SIA self-improvement system** (technically complex, hard to get right)
3. **Network effects from collaboration** (winner-take-most dynamics)
4. **Business intelligence embedded in conversation** (invisible to reverse-engineer)
5. **The "never see code" lock-in with Platform Continuity clause** (trust-based moat)

**Why this matters:** Your 30/60/90 day priorities should over-invest in the hardest-to-copy element.

---

### Question 3: MVP Success Definition

Your success metrics include 10+ apps built and 5+ apps published. But:

**What does a "successful" Vibe app look like at MVP stage?**

Consider:
- **Complexity ceiling**: CRUD app? Landing page with payment? Multi-user with auth?
- **Revenue for the user**: Is it enough if the app works, or must it generate income?
- **Time to publish**: 2 days? 2 weeks? 2 months?
- **User satisfaction**: NPS score? Would recommend? Return rate?

**Why this matters:** Without defining "success," you can't validate whether the system works or just produces demos.

---

### Optional Deep-Dive Questions

If you want to go deeper on any of these areas, let me know:

1. **Credit economics**: What does $1 of AI cost buy the user? How many credits to go from idea → published app?
2. **Escalation rates**: What % of builds do you expect to hit human-in-the-loop? What's your capacity to handle them?
3. **Collaboration friction**: What happens when collaborators disagree during ideation? Who has final say?
4. **Network bootstrapping**: How do you create value before 50-100 apps exist?

---

**How would you like to proceed?** I can:
- Help you write detailed answers to incorporate into the README
- Run a formal evaluation against the 30 criteria
- Red-team specific assumptions (like the SIA system viability)
- Research competitors more deeply (Lovable, Bolt.new, etc.)
