## The Idea: Vibe

**One-liner:** An AI platform that transforms dreamers into founders — from "I have an idea" to "I have a live app" — without ever touching code.

**Name meaning:** **V**alidation, **I**deation, **B**uilding, **E**cosystem + "your vibe becomes matter"

---

## Three Pillars

1. **Ideation** — AI guides from passion to validated concept
2. **Building** — AI generates apps with full context (no garbage prompts)
3. **Network** — AI proactively surfaces collaborators and opportunities

---

## Key Differentiators

- **Context handoff** — Ideation intelligence flows into building
- **Continuous proactive AI** — Ongoing partner, not a tool
- **Self-optimizing platform** — Agents improve other agents (SIA)
- **"Never see code"** — Liberation + lock-in trade-off
- **Aligned revenue** — Platform succeeds when users succeed

---

## Market Opportunity

- No-code market: $28B (2024) → $265B (2032)
- 32% CAGR
- "Vibe coding" = Word of the Year 2025
- 75% of apps will be low-code by 2026 (Gartner)

---

## Revenue Model

| Stream          | Mechanism                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Hosting + DB    | Base cost + margin         |
| Feature Garden  | Monthly per feature        |
| Custom Features | Credits for AI work        |
| Vibe Payments   | Optional % of transactions |
| Paid Testing    | Fee on tester compensation |

---

## 90-Day Roadmap

| Phase      | Focus                         | Target                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Days 1-30  | Ideation agent + orchestrator | Complete core experience |
| Days 31-60 | Spec + Build agents           | End-to-end flow working  |
| Days 61-90 | Hosting + soft launch         | Ready for external users |

---

## Triggers for Full-Time

- 10+ paying strangers
- $2-5K AUD/month revenue
- 40%+ 30-day retention
- Investors reaching out
- 500+ waitlist signups

---

## The Real Fear

Someone beats Vibe to market with more capital.

**Response:** Can't out-capital them. Out-focus and out-iterate. Speed of learning wins.

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete ideation agent polish (Week 1)
2. Build collaboration framework (Week 2)
3. Launch Twitter/X presence (Week 4)
4. Begin co-founder passive search (ongoing)
