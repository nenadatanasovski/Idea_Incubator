I've created a comprehensive **Target Customer Definition** document for Vibe. Here's what it addresses:

## Summary of the New Document

### Primary Target Customer: **"The Capable Dreamer"**
Specifically **corporate employees with side project ambitions** (age 28-45, $80-200K income) who:
- Have ideas sitting in notebooks
- Tried no-code tools and gave up
- Have 5-15 hours/week available
- Want to "finally do something for themselves"

### Key Decisions Made:

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Beachhead = Corporate side-hustlers** | Large market, relatable pain, moderate WTP ($49-99/mo), reachable on Twitter/Reddit |
| **Anti-personas defined** | Technical founders, enterprise IT, get-rich-quick seekers, budget-zero users |
| **Price validation target** | $29-49/mo for ideation, scaling up as value delivered |

### What's Included:
1. **Demographics & psychographics** of primary segment
2. **Jobs to be done** with current failing solutions
3. **Where to find them** (Reddit, Twitter/X, Indie Hackers, podcasts)
4. **Secondary segments** for later expansion (solopreneurs, SMBs, domain experts, creators)
5. **Messaging framework** with do's and don'ts
6. **3-phase validation plan** with specific success metrics
7. **One-sentence customer definition** for alignment

### This Addresses the Viability Risk:
The risk "Target customer not clearly defined" is now mitigated with:
- Specific, actionable customer profile
- Clear validation steps to prove/disprove assumptions
- Anti-personas to avoid wasted effort

**Recommended next step:** Run 10-15 customer discovery interviews using this framework to validate the assumptions.
