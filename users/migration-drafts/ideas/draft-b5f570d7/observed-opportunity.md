I notice you've shared the current state of the **Pet Sitting Marketplace** idea. Looking at the context:

## Current Status

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Confidence** | 28% (low) |
| **Viability** | 75% |
| **Stage** | Forming |

## Key Issues Identified

1. **HIGH RISK**: No market data found - the idea may be too vague or the market search didn't return relevant results
2. **MEDIUM RISK**: Target customer not clearly defined

## What Would Help

To move this idea forward and increase confidence, we should address:

1. **Define the target customer more precisely** - Who exactly are the pet owners? (e.g., busy professionals, frequent travelers, apartment dwellers with dogs who need daily walks?)

2. **Validate the market exists** - There are actually established competitors in this space (Mad Paws, Pawshake, etc. operate in Australia) - we should research them

3. **Clarify the differentiation** - What makes this different from existing pet sitting platforms?

**What would you like to do?**

- `/idea-develop` - Answer questions to flesh out the idea
- `/idea-evaluate` - Run a full 30-criteria evaluation (~$10)
- `/idea-redteam` - Challenge the assumptions

Or I can help you manually explore specific aspects - just let me know what you'd like to focus on (target customer, competition research, differentiation, etc.)
