I see you're working on the **Pet Sitting Marketplace** idea - an app connecting Sydney pet owners with verified local pet sitters.

Looking at the current state, I notice a few things:

1. **Confidence is low (28%)** - The idea is still in the "forming" stage
2. **Viability is at 75%** but with identified risks:
   - **HIGH RISK**: No market data found - this needs validation
   - **MEDIUM RISK**: Target customer not clearly defined

3. **Missing information** in your profile:
   - Your skills, constraints, and goals aren't captured yet
   - This will affect the Personal Fit evaluation scores

What would you like to work on? Here are some options:

| Option | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Develop the idea** | I'll ask clarifying questions to flesh out the concept |
| **Research the market** | Investigate Sydney pet sitting competitors & market size |
| **Create your profile** | Capture your skills/goals for better Fit scoring |
| **Evaluate** | Run the 30-criteria AI evaluation (note: ~$10 budget) |

Or if you have something specific in mind, just let me know! What's "personal" referring to in your task?
